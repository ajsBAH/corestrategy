| Strategy                        | Strategy is a hypothesis — a best guess and set of assumptions as to the appropriate course of action given their knowledge of information concerning the environment, resident competencies, competitive positions, and so on. What is needed is a method to document and test the assumptions inherent in the strategy, and the Balanced Scorecard does just that.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Strategic Management            | Strategic management can be defined as the art and science of formulating, implementing, and evaluating cross-functional decisions that enable an organization to achieve its objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Stakeholders                    | A Stakeholder represents the role of an individual, Team, or Organization (or classes thereof) that represents their interests in the effects of the architecture.  A Stakeholder has one or more interests in, or concerns about, the Organization and its enterprise architecture. To direct efforts to these interests and concerns, stakeholders change, set, and emphasize goals.                                                                                                                                           |
| Principle                       | A Principle represents a statement of intent defining a general property that applies to any system in a particular context in the business.  Principles define the intended properties of systems. A Principle defines a general property that applies to any system in a particular context. A Principle is motivated by some goal or driver. Organizational values, best practices, and design knowledge may be reflected and made applicable principles.                                                                     |
| Strategy Planning               | Strategic planning is an organization's process of defining its strategy or direction and allocating its resources to pursue this strategy—generally, strategic planning impacts the entire Organization instead of a single division, department, or project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Tactical Planning               | Tactical planning is short-range planning emphasizing the current operations of various parts of the Organization. Short Range is defined as a period extending about one year or less in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Operational Planning            | Operational planning is the process of linking strategic goals and objectives to tactical goals and objectives. It describes milestones conditions for success and explains how, or what portion of, a strategic plan will be put into operation during a given operational period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Perspective                     | Perspective refers to a category of performance objectives or measures. Most organizations choose the standard four perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Strategic Theme                 | Strategic themes are the primary, high-level business strategies that form the Organization's business model. We sometimes refer to themes as "pillars of excellence."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Performance Criteria            | Performance criteria express what is to be measured and why (i.e., how success is defined). The selection process involves identifying dimensions and variables relevant to an enterprise's successful operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Drivers                         | A Driver represents an external or internal condition that motivates an organization to define its goals and implement the changes necessary to achieve them. Drivers may be internal; in which case they are usually associated with a Stakeholder. They may also be external, e.g., economic changes or changing legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Goal                            | A goal in an organization describes what a company expects or hopes to accomplish over a specific period, in other words, where it hopes to be at a future date. Goals are observable and measurable results having one or more objectives to be achieved. Goals are typically broad in scope. For example, a goal might be for an organization to "increase profits." Or an individual might have a goal to "become certified."                                                                                                 |
| SMART Goals                     | A SMART goal is used to help guide goal setting. SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Therefore, a SMART goal incorporates all these criteria to help focus your efforts and increase the chances of achieving your goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Objectives                      | Objectives are a specific result you are trying to achieve within a period and with available resources. They are considered more specific and more accessible to measure than a goal. Think of them as the steps you will take to achieve the goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Strategic Initiatives/Projects  | Strategic initiatives are the specific projects, activities, or programs you will embark upon to meet or exceed your performance targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Outcome                         | An Outcome represents a result. Outcomes are high-level, business-oriented results produced by the capabilities of an organization. Outcomes are closely related to requirements, goals, and other intentions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Balanced Scorecard              | The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a strategic planning and management system. Organizations us BSCs (balanced scorecard) to: * Communicate what they are trying to accomplish * Align the day-to-day work that everyone is doing with strategy * Prioritize projects, products, and services * Measure and monitor progress towards strategic targets The name "balanced scorecard" comes from the idea of looking at strategic measures in addition  traditional financial measures to get a more "balanced" view of performance. |
| Strategy Map                    | A strategy map visual represents an organization's overall objectives and how they relate to one another. The map is created during the strategic planning process and is used as primary reference material during periodic strategy check-in and review meetings. It is one of the main components of the balanced scorecard methodology.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Objective and Key Results (OKR) | Objectives and key results (OKR) is a goal-setting framework that helps organizations define goals — or objectives — and then track the outcome. The framework is designed to help organizations establish far-reaching goals in days instead of months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mind-Map                        | A mind map is a hierarchical diagram that shows the complete strategic management relationship from the Organization's vision to all the objectives and programs in a single diagram. It helps show the BIG picture within the Organization, which helps users prioritize tasks and make informed decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Strategy Tree                   | A Strategy Tree is a way to lay out and define your strategic plan. It can be used to guide your strategy formation, communicate the plan to your team or stakeholders and as a way to report on progress Core-Strategy against your overall goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
