# Introduction to Core-Strategy

Core-Strategy bridges the gap between the organization's strategy, goals, objectives, and execution. It enables leaders to have increased visibility into the Organization's capabilities, resources and limitations when investing, divesting, prioritizing, or undertaking transformative technology changes. It helps to translate and map organization strategy with its mission and technical capabilities, which further serves as the foundation for understanding dependencies and constraints for increased execution success.

**Core-Strategy helps our customers to gain real-time intelligence (alignment, accountability, and progress) of the organization's, teams and personal goals, objectives, and strategic initiatives**
